# Overview

This guide aims to introduce you how to build your own keyboard firmware using RMK and run it on your microcontroller. There are 3 steps of the guide:

- setup the RMK environment

- create a RMK project

- compile the firmware and flash

## Before we start

Using RMK requires basic knowledge of **Rust programming** and **embedded devices**. If you're not familiar with Rust, [The Official Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) is a good start. And, if you're not familiar with embedded Rust, we recommend you to read [The Embedded Rust Book](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/) first. We'll keep working on making RMK more accessible for everybody.
